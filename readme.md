# Project: Recursion

After learning that recursion is the idea of a function calling itself, The Odin Project is having me write the fibonacci and Merge Sort algorithm to test my understanding. My goal is to give myself a week to fully grasp recursion and then implement the solution. This lesson is part of their JavaScript Course, under A Bit of Computer Science
