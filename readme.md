# Project: Recursion

After learning that recursion is the idea of a function calling itself, The Odin Project is having me write the fibonacci and Merge Sort algorithm to test my understanding. My goal is to give myself a week to fully grasp recursion and then implement the solution. This lesson is part of their JavaScript Course, under A Bit of Computer Science

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence, is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence.

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is one such sorting algorithm, and can be much faster than other algorithms such as bubble sort on the right data sets. Essentially merge sort recurses through an array of unsorted data until it reaches its smallest sub-set, a single item. Of course an array with a single item is considered sorted. Merge sort then merges the single items back together in sorted order. Pretty clever!
